# Genesys for FoundryVTT

An attempt at implementing the Genesys Charactersheet for FoundryVTT.

The Genesys RPG is made by FantasyFlightGames.

To use this System you have to download and enable the Special Dice Roller module.

Initiative has to be manually added to the combattracker.

This is just an updated version I made with a couple of fixes to the character sheet.

Paste this link when foundry requests a manifest:
